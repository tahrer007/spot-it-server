## About the App
### about the idea
The wild pigs of Haifa have invaded almost all the city. as a stranger, I didn't know where I can be without meeting them. I asked myself all the time, if I could know which streets they visit frequently.

### how it is work ?
the app shows all the locations of spotted boars in the last 48 hours. as well as the most affected neighborhoods.
